# üîê Password Cracking Simulator (PCS)

A lightweight and simplified simulator that demonstrates how password cracking can be accelerated using distributed systems principles. Built using Python and Flask, PCS uses a master-worker architecture to emulate real-world password cracking workflows‚Äî**ethically and safely** using only synthetic data.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is meant for educational purposes **ONLY** and should never be used for unethical purposes.

## Addressing Current System Issues

### Limitations in Existing Systems

| Problem | Limitation in Current Tools | PCS Solution |
|--------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Complexity | Tools like Fitcrack require advanced setups (BOINC, GPUs) | Simplified architecture using Python + Flask |
| Ethical Concerns | Real tools use actual password hashes or cracked data | Only synthetic data used in PCS |
| Lack of Transparency | Tools are black-boxed, difficult to understand for learners | Full visibility into queueing, distribution, and logic |
| No Teaching Focus | Designed for performance, not pedagogy | Designed for student-friendly understanding and experimentation |
| Hidden Fault Behavior | Failures handled internally with no explanation | PCS (extensible) can simulate node failures and retries |

## üéØ Project Goals

- Demonstrate **task distribution** in distributed systems
- Showcase **worker coordination and resilience**
- Promote **security awareness** around password vulnerabilities
- Provide an **educational and ethical** tool to simulate password cracking

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

![Architecture Design](./assets/Architecture.jpg)

The system follows a master-worker distributed architecture:
- **Master Node**: Coordinates tasks, manages worker health, distributes workload
- **Worker Nodes**: Process password cracking tasks, report results and status
- **GUI Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring and control interface
